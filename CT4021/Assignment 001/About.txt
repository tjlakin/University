This entire game is based of the creature known as the Grue.
The Grue is a fictional predatory monster that dwells in the dark.
The Grue waits for any adventurer to venture into the darkness.
If the adventurer does not have adequate light source ( for this game it will be the room lights or a flashlight),
the Grue will attack and devour you.
Do everything in each room because when you leave, you can't go back.
I wish you good look when venturing throughout the game.
