Well done for turning the lights on for this room.
You made the Grue runaway.
I can now tell you more about your exit.
The final door has a 3 step process to unlock.
A ---e , --y--r- and a -e-.
You didn't think I would make it easy for you did you.
You may have the items already you may not.
Oh and before I finish,
Whatever you do DON'T OPEN THE CLOSET.
