If you went to the right you would have died
You see, a monster called the Grue haunts this mansion and only attacks in the dark.
This room illuminated as you saw when you came in, the other room doesn't.
Your goal is to work your way through the mansion and get to the garden.
You have taken that flashlight?, good you will need it as some rooms don't have much light.
However in this room, you can find the fusebox to light the room to the right of the entrance.
There are also other puzzles in here. Oh and also collect as much money as you can.
I suggest you do everything in each room because when you leave, you can't go back.
Good Luck, you'll need it.
